Provenance is key to the success of monetization of digital media because it helps to establish trust and credibility in the online space, without which it can be difficult to determine the reliability of the information or the value of digital assets. In a decentralized, user-owned and controlled internet, individuals and organizations need to be able to verify the authenticity of the information and assets they encounter.

Numbers Protocol secures digital media provenance through a decentralized ecosystem and blockchain technology, akin to a version control system like Git. Numbers tracks changes made to digital assets, allowing for collaboration and management. The Numbers Mainnet functions as a decentralized Github, storing data related to assets, such as provenance, ownership, and historical records, securely and transparently.

In addition, the [assetization process](https://docs.numbersprotocol.io/introduction/numbers-protocol/defining-web3-assets/assetization-process) defined by Numbers Protocol can be seen as an approach of building personalized AI datasets. The registered digital content and their provenance metadata can be used to train AI models that can be used for a variety of purposes. Provenance ensured by Numbers Protocol can help to provide records of where the data came from and how it should be used. This is important in building trust between individuals and organizations that collect and use personal data, especially in the Generative AI future.
Our long-term vision is to establish a transparent, fair, and authentic digital media ecosystem that promotes accountability and ensures the safe and secure use of data and AI.

This video provides a high-level overview of Numbers Protocol and how it works.
